      Since 1875 East End House has offered innovative programming to the community and continues to strive for excellence as we look to the future. Our programs have received numerous accolades and distinctions. In 2010 East End House became the first in the country to be accredited as an overall agency and to earn separate accreditation for the School Age and Middle School Programs through the Council on Accreditation (COA). In both 2009 and 2010 the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the United Neighborhood Centers of America recognized excellence in family engagement programming through the national Families Count: Family Strengthening Award. East End House was also awarded the Massachusetts Nonprofit Networkâ€™s Management Award in 2010. The agency continues to create innovative and essential programs for the children, youth, families, and seniors in our community.
